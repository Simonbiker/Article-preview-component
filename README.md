## My process

Started with mobile first development. Worked on the styling for that first. 
Then moved onto the how the desktop looked. 
Once I was happy that the bulk of the styling was done for the mobile screen and deskop screen, I moved onto the Javascript side. 
Worked on getting the JS file to insure that social div was hidden when the page was rendered. Then made sure that the toggle worked correctly. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development
I am not happy with the end styling for the desktop after the button click. I will need to work on how to style the elements using SASS and Javascript
