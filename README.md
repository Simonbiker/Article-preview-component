## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

Started with mobile first development. Worked on the styling for that first. 
Then moved onto the how the desktop looked. 
Once I was happy that the bulk of the styling was done for the mobile screen and deskop screen, I moved onto the Javascript side. 
Worked on getting the JS file to insure that social div was hidden when the page was rendered. Then made sure that the toggle worked correctly. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development
I am not happy with the end styling for the desktop after the button click. I will need to work on how to style the elements using SASS and Javascript
